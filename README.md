# Capstone-Project
This repository is for my Springboard Capstone Project.

Below are my project ideas.

1. Stocks Watchlist and Analysis App

   *I'm most interested in making this*
   
   Problem:  Every retail investor needs an easy way to find potential stocks to buy.
   
   Solution: I've been using StockButler.com and MarketChameleon.com, which can do the fundamental analysis for me. However, I can make a better, more specialized app     
             based on certain criteria, and then I won't need a monthly subscription to those sites. I plan on using the API from Schwab and Yahoo Finance to get data. In 
             the end, my app will make it easier for me to make money trading the financial markets.
   
3. Fantasy Sports App

   Problem:  Fantasy sports are fun, so why not make it more fun?
   
   Solution: Years ago, the NBA used to have the NBA Stock Exchange, which was discontinued. It was a different take on fantasy sports, because the user could
             draft and manage a team of players, who's values would change based on their performance throughout the season. A player could start out being worth $200k, 
             then they could have a breakout season and now they're worth $20M. All of the users could see who was ahead on the leaderboard. Using the Yahoo Fantasy Sports 
             API, I can make a new and improved version of this app. 

5. Music Playlist and Tour Dates App

   Problem:  Everyone has a playlist of songs with various artists, but it's difficult to find when and where they are all touring.
   
   Solution: This app will reference all of the songs a user has in their playlist and identify all of the artists and what their tour dates are. This way,
             it's much easier for users to find out when and where the artists in their playlist are performing, as well as ticket prices. Some bands are lesser
             known and it's more difficult to find where they are playing. This app solves that problem. I can use Ticketmaster's API for this.
